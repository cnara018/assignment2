				I am an experienced bilingual Technical Support Engineer, skilled in both hardware and software related troubleshooting. I 
graduated from Florida International University with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (focuses centered in 
Software Development and Database Administration). I am highly adept in system analysis, diagnostics, troubleshooting, and 
conflict resolution. I do my best to demonstrate excellent organizational and problem-solving skills and I genuinely love to work in 
team environments. When it comes to service, my goal is to always offer the best possible technical support I can and 
professionally translate the sometimes complex methods of troubleshooting to something everyone can understand.
